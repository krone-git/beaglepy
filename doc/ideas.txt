Organism variables

Reproductive Trait
    - per organism
    - arbitrary numeric value
    - compared between members of a breeding pair to determine
        reproductive feasibility
    - if difference between members is greater than speciation threshold,
        breeding fails

Survival Trait
    - per organism
    - arbitrary numeric value
    - compared to survival target of environment
    - if difference between organism and environment is greater than
        environments survival target, they cannot breed.

Consumption Trait
    - per organism
    - determines how much resource is consumed by organism prior to
        reproduction
    - environment has limited resources, the most survival fit will be
        prioritized in resource allocation
    - organisms whose consumption trait is not met cannot breed.

Territory Range
    - per organism
    - determines how far an organism can move from its current position.

Offspring Range
    - curve or static, global (or per environment?)
    - RNG coordinate range from the center distance between
        members of a breeding pair in which a new organism created

Proliferation Modifier
    - per organism
    - modifier that determines how much survival and consumption fitness
        contributes to offspring rate
    - should not be lower than 1

Fitness (Survival/Reproductive)
    - per organism
    - absolute distance between organism's trait and environment/reproduction
        target
    - the closer fitness is to 0, the more fit the organism

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Environment variables

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Global variables

Breeding Population Range
    - static, global
    - environment is broken into breeding range baskets
    - organisms within breeding range form breeding pairs

Speciation Threshold
    - static, global
    - organism reproduction trait comparison;
        if difference between organisms > threshold,
        organisms cannot breed.

Mutation Rate
    - static, global
    - RNG roll to determine if mutation occurs in given trait
    - roll for modifier for each trait in each breeding pair

Mutation Variance Modifier Range
    - curve or static, global
    - RNG roll to determine trait modifier for trait mutation

Inheritance Model
    - static, per trait
    - dominance or average based
    - either can be weighted in either direction
