Collection Process
    - collect organisms into baskets to be used in Survival and Reproduction

Survival Process
    - orders organisms by survival fitness
    - organisms below survival threshold
    (
    Consumption Process
        - allocates environment resources to fittest organisms
        - when resources are depleted no unprocessed organisms can breed
    )
Reproduction Process
    - orders organisms by reproduction trait
    (
    Speciation Process
        - establishes breeding pairs in ascending order
        - if distance between current and previous index if greater than
            speciation threshold, new pool of breeding pairs is established
        - if population is uneven, least fit organism in pool is removed

    Inheritance Process
        - Dominance Strategy
            - randomly selects trait from one parent for inheritance
        - Random Strategy
            - randomly selects value between traits of both parents for
                inheritance
        - Average Strategy
            - uses the rounded average of trait between both parents for
                inheritance

    Mutation Process
        - roll RNG per breeding pair to determine if mutation event occurs
        - randomly select trait for each mutation event
        - apply RNG roll modifier to trait of offspring

    Proliferation Process
        - generate a number of organisms equal to the inherited proliferation
            trait of offspring.
    )
Recording Process
    - record generation data into geneology to be exported after completion
        of the simulation

End Check Process
    - if no organisms are left alive, end the simulation loop and move on
        to export process.

Upkeep Process
    (
    Replenishment Process
        - replenish all environments' resource count based on their modifier
            up to their max
    )

Event Process
    - activate any relevant event commands on current simulation state

*Repeat

Export Process
    - export to specified path with specified format
        - path should be directory, not filename
    - supported formats
        csv,
        txt,
        json,
        file-like,
        dict
    - exports files
        simulation state
            - global variables indexed by generation #
        organism geneology
            - all organism values indexed by organism id and generation #
        environment history
            - all environment values indexed by environment id and generation #
        event history
            - all events and that

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Organism variables

Id
    - unique identifier for each organism

Parents
    - ids of both parent organisms

Reproductive Trait
    - arbitrary numeric value
    - compared between members of a breeding pair to determine
        reproductive feasibility
    - if difference between members is greater than speciation threshold,
        breeding fails

Survival Trait
    - arbitrary numeric value
    - compared to survival target of environment
    - if difference between organism and environment is greater than
        environments survival target, they cannot breed.

Consumption Trait
    - determines how much resource is consumed by organism prior to
        reproduction
    - environment has limited resources, the most survival fit will be
        prioritized in resource allocation
    - organisms whose consumption trait is not met cannot breed.

Offspring Radius
    - how far offspring can spawn from the center distance between members
        of a breeding pair

Proliferation Modifier
    - modifier that determines how much survival and consumption fitness
        contributes to offspring count
    - should not be lower than 1 (?)

Fitness (Survival/Reproductive)*
    - per organism
    - absolute distance between organism's trait and environment/reproduction
        target
    - the closer fitness is to 0, the more fit the organism

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Environment variables

Max Longitude and Max Latitude
    - Root environment only
    - the max longitude and latitude an organism or sub environment can have

Longitude and Latitude
    - coordinates for the center point of an environment

Range radius
    - max distance an organism can be from environment center to contained
        within that environment

##Range function
##    - function that determines the outer edge of an environment
##    - coordinates of an organism are passed to function to determine if
##        organism is contained within that environment

Survival Target
    - arbitrary numeric value
    - determines survival fitness of organisms contained within the
        environment

Max Resource
    - max number of resources contained within the environment
    - allocated to the most fit organisms in the environment
    - determines which of the fittest organisms can breed.

Resource Replenishment Rate
    - rate at which resources will replenish within the environment

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Global variables

Breeding Population Range
    - static, global
    - environment is broken into breeding range baskets
    - organisms within breeding range form breeding pairs

Survival Threshold
    - static, global
    - organism survival trait comparison;
        if difference between organism > threshold,
        organism cannot breed.

Speciation Threshold
    - static, global
    - organism reproduction trait comparison;
        if difference between organism > threshold,
        organism cannot breed.

Mutation Rate
    - static, global
    - RNG roll to determine if mutation occurs in given trait
    - roll for modifier for each trait in each breeding pair

Mutation Variance Modifier Range
    - curve or static, global
    - RNG roll to determine trait modifier for trait mutation

Inheritance Model
    - static, per trait
    - dominance or average based
    - either can be weighted in either direction
